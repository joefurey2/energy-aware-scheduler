# Energy aware scheduling in Kubernetes

This repository is part of my undergraduate dissertation - Energy aware scheduling in Kubernetes.

The project will involve creating and implementing a custom Kubernetes scheduling mechanism with an aim to schedule workloads in a more energy efficient way than the default.

This project will also utilise a Kubernetes cluster monitoring framework, and will require implementation of tools to emasure the power consumption and energy efficiency of each node in a cluster.
